Tasks
=====

Definition
----------

Tasks encapsulate fully independent units of execution. Flyte language exposes an extensible model
to express that in an execution-independent language. Flyte contains first class task plugins that take
care of executing these tasks.

Plugin Examples
----------------
Almost any action can be implemented and introduced into Flyte as a Plugin.
 - So tasks that run queries on distributed data warehouses like Redshift, Hive, Snowflake etc can be a task (using plugins)
 - Tasks that run executions on compute engines like Spark, Flink, AWS Sagemaker, AWS Batch, Kubernetes pods, jobs etc
 - Tasks that call web services

Flyte ships with some defaults, for example running a simple python function does not need any hosted service, so Flyte knows how to
execute these tasks on Kubernetes. Turns out these are the vastt majority of tasks in ML and Flyte is deftly adept at handling a very large
scale on kubernetes. this is achieved by implementing a unique scheduler on top of K8s.

Dynamic Tasks
---------------
Dynamic tasks is a misnomer. Flyte is one of a kind Workflow engine that ships with a concept of truly dynamic workflows. Users can generate workflows
in reaction to user inputs or computed values at runtime. And these executions are evaluated to generate a static graph, before execution.

Characteristics
---------------

In abstract, a task in the system is characterized by:

1. A :ref:`divedeep-projects` and :ref:`divedeep-domains` combination,
2. A unique unicode name (we recommend it not to exceed 32 characters), and
3. A version string.
4. *Optional* Task interface definition

   In order for tasks to exchange data with each other, a task can define a signature (much like a function/method
   signature in programming languages). A task interface defines the input and output variables - :std:ref:`flyteidl:api_field_flyteidl.core.variablemap.variables`
   as well as their types :std:ref:`flyteidl:api_msg_flyteidl.core.literaltype`.

Requirements
------------

When deciding whether a unit of execution constitutes a Flyte Task or not. Consider the following:

- Is there a well-defined graceful/successful exit criteria for the task? A task is expected to exit after finishing processing
  its inputs.

- Is it repeatable? Under certain circumstances, a task might be retried, rerun... etc. with the same inputs. It's expected
  to produce the same outputs every single time. For example, avoid using random number generators with current clock as seed
  but opt to using a system-provided clock as the seed. 

- Is it a pure function? i.e. does it have side effects that are not known to the system (e.g. calls a web-service). It's strongly
  advisable to avoid side-effects in tasks. When side-effects are required, ensure that those operations are idempotent.

Types
-----
Since it's impossible to define the unit of execution of a task the same way for all kinds of tasks, Flyte allows different task
types in the system. Flyte comes with a set of defined, battle tested task types but also allows for a very flexible model to
introducing new :ref:`plugins_extend_intro`.

Fault tolerance
---------------
In any distributed system failure is inevitable, allowing users to design a fault-tolerant system (e.g. workflow) is an inherent goal of Flyte. At a high level, tasks offer two parameters to control how to handle that:

Retries
  Tasks can define a retry strategy to let the system know how to handle failures (e.g. retry 3 times on any errors).

Timeouts
  In order for the system to ensure it's always making progress, tasks must be guaranteed to end. The system defines a default timeout
  period for tasks. It's also possible for task authors to define a timeout period after which the task is marked as failure. Note that
  a timed-out task will be retried if it has a retry strategy defined.

Memoization
-----------
Flyte supports memoization for task outputs to ensure identical invocations of a task are not repeatedly executed wasting compute resources.
For more information on memoization please refer to :ref:`howto-enable-use-memoization`.
